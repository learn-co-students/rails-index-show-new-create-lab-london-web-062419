# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  coupons = Coupon.create([{ coupon_code: '1234', store: 'Macys' }, { coupon_code: '23345', store:'Lowes'},{ coupon_code: '3456', store: 'Harrods'},{ coupon_code: '5678', store: 'Kiehls'}])
